# Geographic Center

## Analysis
This script was developed to investigate movement of the COVID-19 case-weighted centroid in Brazil throughout the course of the pandemic. The national centroid is calculated by taking the geographic centroid of each municipality as a set of points, finding the national geographic centroid from those points, and then weighting the position of the national centroid by the case count of COVID-19 in each municipality.

### Outcome
With this script, we were able to plot the path of the COVID-19 weighted centroids with line strings and a centroid at the location of the final week's centroid. We also include a choropleth map for the case count in the last available epidemiological week using an exponential classification due to the wide range of case counts in the different municipalities. We also wanted a table exported containing lengths of each line connecting the centroids, the length between each centroid and the capital city, and the direction of the line. These were included to answer specific research questions.

### Guidance
This script may be adapted to different countries by an individual comfortable with R scripting. This process will work with any sub-unit of a nation, whether it be regions, states, counties, municpalities, or census tracts, as long as there are smaller units which make up a larger unit for which you want to find the weighted centroid for. In order to adapt this script, we recommend the following files/formats and potential code changes:

__Input files:__  

* Sub-unit boundary shapefile: including -  
    * Unique identifier for the sub-unit: Municipality ID (ibge_code)
    * Geographic boundaries for the shapefiles (`Brazil_municipalities_shapefile` )
    * example:

* Covid-19 case CSV (`all_epi_week_daily_deaths_cases_by_mun_and_state.csv`) including -  
    * sub-unit unique identifier: Municipality ID (ibge_code)
    * Week number: (epidemiological_week)
    * Date number: (date)
    * COVID-19 case count (daily.cases)
    * example:  
![data_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43140693/111041744-c46c4700-8407-11eb-9fb1-8e9e63078089.png)
    
* Optional:
    * Another unit boundary shapefile: we also have a state boundaries shapefile which is only used in the visualization ( `Brazil_state_shapefile` )
    * Capital location shapefile: included to calculate the distance of each weekly weighted centroid to the capital city (`Brazil_state_capitals` )

    
__Code changes:__  
To adapt this code to your data, please make the following changes (line numbers reference `brazil_national_cases_workflow.Rmd`)
* File paths: change line numbers 20, 25, 29, 36, 44, 52, 350, 362, 383, 387
* Numbers for start and end week: change line number 70, 72, 76, 78, 142, 143, 185, 191, 200, 209, 345


__Visualizations/ plotting:__
To adapt this code to your data, please make the following changes (line numbers reference `brazil_national_cases_workflow.Rmd`)
* Exponential classification: can be altered in the map creation in line number 347
* Map title, labels, etc.: change in line number 347


## Manuscript Output
This code produces  .gif files: `gif/Nation_cases_centroids.gif` and `gif/Nation_deaths_centroids.gif`.

__Fig. 2A__ and __Fig. 2B__ present the path of the COVID-19 case- and death-weighted geographic centers to show the movement of the epidemic centroid in Brazil over time. __Fig. S2__ shows maps for the movement of the centroid for COVID-19 cases and deaths in each state.

This R script also calculates the length of each line connecting the centroids, the length between each centroid and the capital city, and the direction of the lineâ€™s movement. In the case of states, we also calculated the distance between the capital city and the furthest municipality in the state. That distance was the denominator of a ratio that considered the length of the line connecting centroids each week as the numerator (the largest the ratio, the further cases or deaths moved to the interior) 
  * __Fig. 2D__ (`figures/Figure2`)
  * __Table S4__  (`6_correlations/data/distance-case.csv`)
  * __Table S5__ (`6_correlations/data/distance-death.csv`)

__Fig. 1A__ and __Fig. 1B__ (`/figure/Figure1`) were generated using ArcMap.
